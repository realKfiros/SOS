# SOS
SOS is a really simple pencil and paper game.
I searched a great game for a school project that you can't find online.
I've got the idea of this game from a good friend.

<b>Requirements</b>  
To run this project you need:
* Python 2.7
* Kivy
Run with:
`$ python main.py`
## The rules of the game
1. Number of players: 2
2. Board size: 9x9
3. Number of turns: 81 turns, 41 for the first player and 40 for the second
4. In each turn the player needs to choose a character: 'S' or 'O'
5. The player gets point if he made an 'SOS' streak in his turn: row, column or slant. Theoretically you can get a maximum of 12 points.
6. The game is over when all of the squares in the board are occupied (after 81 turns)
7. The winner is the player who has more points.
